# Analysis of the correctness of sports technique on muscle EMG signal

The aim of this study is to use non-invasive global electromyography, especially the myoelectric signal of the biceps brachii muscle, to analyze the correctness of sports technique. This topic was undertaken due to the desire to directly look into the work of the muscle and assess muscle tone. In addition, it was considered that the analysis of the biceps function would allow to deepen the knowledge about sports training and improve sports technique during exercise.
